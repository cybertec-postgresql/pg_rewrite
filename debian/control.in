Description: Track failed PostgreSQL login attempts, and lockout users
 Track failed PostgreSQL login attempts, such as due to password mismatch, and
 lock out automatically users to prevent brute-force attacks. Each unauthorized
 access attempt gets recorded within the log table. If the number of
 unsuccessful access attempts exceeds the specified limit (pg_rewrite.limit)
 within the specified period (pg_rewrite.period), the user gets locked out of
 this database cluster. It cannot record access attempts that match reject
 entries in pg_hba.conf, as that would require patching the server.
